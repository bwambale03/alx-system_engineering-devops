// for  user wanting to access your website.
    User enters www.foobar.com in their web browser.

    The user's device sends a DNS (Domain Name System) request to the configured DNS resolver to translate the domain name (www.foobar.com) into an IP address.

    The DNS resolver checks its cache for a matching IP address. If not found, it queries the DNS root servers to find the authoritative name servers for the ".com" top-level domain.

    The DNS resolver then queries the authoritative name servers for the IP address of www.foobar.com.

    The authoritative name servers respond with the IP address associated with www.foobar.com.

    The DNS resolver caches the IP address for future use and sends it back to the user's device.

    The user's device establishes a TCP/IP connection with the server hosting www.foobar.com using the obtained IP address.

    The server receives the incoming request on port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS) and processes it.

    If the request is on port 80, the server responds with an HTTP redirect (status code 301 or 302) to the HTTPS version of the website (https://www.foobar.com).

    If the request is on port 443, the server proceeds to handle the HTTPS request.

    The server decrypts the HTTPS request using its SSL/TLS certificate, ensuring secure communication between the user's device and the server.

    The server processes the request, which may involve retrieving HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and any other required assets from the server's file system or a connected database.

    The server generates an HTML response and includes any dynamic content based on the requested URL or user-specific data.

    The server sends the response back to the user's device over the established TCP/IP connection.

    The user's device receives the response and renders the web page in the web browser, displaying the website's content and assets.

    The user can interact with the website by clicking links, submitting forms, or performing other actions, which results in subsequent requests being sent to the server for processing.
